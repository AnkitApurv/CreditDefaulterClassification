# CreditDefaulterClassification
Internship

Project Type: Classification

### Objectives:
1. To understand the nature and flow of a data analysis project.
2. To To explore the many exploratroy, pre-processing and classification (limited to shallow learning) techniques available.
3. To choose an appropriate model selection criteria, then subsequently the winning model.

### Current Status:
Project completed, DNNClassifier using Tensorflow is part of the future scope.

### Scope of improvement:
1. Better feature engineering (Possibilities with Pay_Delay concept?).
2. Outlier removal and then feature normalization (so that the vast majority of data points aren't bunched-up).
3. Use of deep learning alogrithm.

### Disclaimer:
The dataset and tools used in the project are publicly available.
